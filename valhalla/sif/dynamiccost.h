 * Derived classes must implement methods to consider if access is allowed,
 * compute a cost to traverse an edge, and a couple other methods required to
 * setup A* heuristics and sorting methods. Derived classes can also define
 * edge transition (intersection/turn) costing. EdgeCost and TransitionCost
 * methods return a Cost structure includes a cost for Dijkstra/A* as well as
 * the elapsed time (seconds) so that time along the path can be estimated
 * (for transit schedule lookups. timed restrictions, and other time dependent
